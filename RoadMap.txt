C# AntFarm

Minimum viable script:

[Serializable]
class AntFarm : IAntFarm
{
    public void Render( ... ) {}
}

We don't even need ants.  This is basically EvalPoc with serialization of IScript.

1) Save the antfarm so it's persisted between recompiles.
2) Save the script so I can shut it off and turn it back on again. DONE
3) Might as well throw both in AppData.
4) VS integration would just be a matter of snaking off a class library project and using a filesystem listener
